Student Information Management System

Project Overview
The Student Information Management System (SIMS)
is a web-based application designed to facilitate 
the management of student information. 
The system allows administrators to log in 
and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
operations on student records, 
ensuring data accuracy and ease of access.

Project Objectives
User Authentication: Implement a secure login system where only administrators 
can access the system to manage student records.
Student CRUD Operations: Develop functionality to Create, Read, Update,
and Delete student records.
Database: Create and manage a database to store student information securely.
User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive user interface for administrators
to interact with the system easily.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features
User Authentication
Admins can log in using a unique username and password.
Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.
Student Records
Admins can add new student records, including fields such as name, contact information, and email.
Admins can view a list of all existing student records with basic details (e.g., name, email).
Admins can click on a student record to view detailed information.
Admins can edit and update student records.
Admins can delete student records.

Database
Create a relational database schema to store student information.
Implement database tables for students, admins, and user authentication.

User Interface
Design a clean and user-friendly web interface for admin users.
Ensure responsive design for use on various devices (desktop and mobile).
Implement clear navigation and user prompts for CRUD operations.
